# ProjectEulerPython

Description: Project Euler is a wonderful free resource that allows users to practice problem solving via programming languages of the user's choice. I've personally used it for learning VisualBasic, Javascript, Python, and the HotDocs Scripting Language in the past. 

Last time I sprinted through Project Euler with Python as my learning language I believe it was part of a drinking game.
