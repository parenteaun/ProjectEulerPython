Title: Largest palindrome product

Problem 4
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
'''

'''
Background Review:
The smallest 3 digit numbers are 100. 100x100 = 10,000
The largest 3 digit numbers are 999. 999x999 = 998,001
We only need to traverse this range backwards and search for 3 digit factors.

Goal: Create a function to identify palidromic numbers
Goal: Create a function to then check for factors.

	Using int() below truncates the decimal point for odd numbers of digits.
	for odd numbered digits the middle number doesnt matter for palindromes.
